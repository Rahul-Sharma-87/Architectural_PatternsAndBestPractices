Big O asymptotic Analysis

Graph is allocated against time and distance, to check the possible with large number of inputs

T = an + b = variable term is considered, fastest growing term and cofficient is taken = O(n)
T = 5n2+n+1 = O(n2)

Types of Algo Graphs 
- Linear time - O(n)
- Constant time - O(1)
- Quadratic time - O(n -sq)

10-pwr-6			10-pwr-6 = 100s	- O(n)					  10-pwr-3 = 1s - O(sqrt n)

N X N array - find sum - Needs to traverse N*N times - hence O(N2)

* N square is as N2
